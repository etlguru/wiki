## Standard Edition

Visual Importer ETL Standard Edition and Advanced ETL Processor Standard Edition are not compatible. We recommend users of Visual Importer ETL Standard to migrate to Advanced ETL Processor Professional Edition

## Professional Edition

Visual Importer ETL Professional Edition is compatible with Advanced ETL Processor Professional Edition.

## Enterprise Edition

Visual Importer ETL Professional Edition is compatible with Advanced ETL Processor Professional Edition.

## Repository

Both Professional and Enterprise Editions are use [repository]({{<relref "docs/advanced-etl-processor/repository-database" >}}) database to store data. The repository database structure is the same for both editions. Multiple users of our ETL software can connect to the same repository and share the data

**Visual importer ETL** is the first ETL software product we created.
Since then we have designed **[Advanced ETL Processor](https://www.etl-tools.com/advanced-etl-processor/overview.html)** which is fully compatible with it and has much more features.\
For all new users we recommend **[Advanced ETL Processor](https://www.etl-tools.com/advanced-etl-processor/overview.html)**
