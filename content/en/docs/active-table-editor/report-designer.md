One of the major benefits of working with [Active Table Editor](https://www.etl-tools.com/active-table-editor/overview.html) it's ability to create rich report.

## Report Designer

The units of measurement in the report can be determined from the horizontal and vertical rulers shown in the display. The units of measurement are usually based on centimeters, but this can be changed if required. This enables the user to design the exact layout of the data and titles on the report on paper before the report is designed. Therefore, it is possible to use “X” and “Y” measurements.
