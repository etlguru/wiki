There several ways to automate execution of objects.

- First of all it is possible to run them from the command line. It can be part of a batch script or windows scheduler can be used for unattended execution.
- Next possibility is integrated scheduler. it can be also used for unattended execution (Enterprise version)
- And last option is the Event monitors.

Event monitor waits for certain event to happen (for example new file arrival into the directory) and when it does happens it executes predefined task.
