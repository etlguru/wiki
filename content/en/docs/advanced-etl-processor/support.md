## Solving problems today

We respect your time and hope you respect ours.

People ask us the same questions again and again,

Please do not be selfish and use our support forum, save your time and help the other users.
We are here to help you.

A lot of issues can be resolved in minutes provided that you supply all the necessary information:

- Version Number
- Repository type
- Database type you are working with
- Useful screenshots so we can see your entire screen not just error message
- Steps to reproduce the problem eg click this click that => got an error message
- Description of the problem: Want to do this.. Do not know how...
- Suggestions or ideas. (we do implement most of them)

If you do not provide this information, we will ask for it anyway and you will waste time.

We intend to resolve 90 percent of the reported problems within 48 hours.
Most difficult issues or functionality extension are resolved within one week
