MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. MIME is an Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs. Message bodies may consist of multiple parts, and header information may be specified in non-ASCII character sets. Email messages with MIME formatting are typically transmitted with standard protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the Post Office Protocol (POP), and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). Another way of describing MIME is a way of combining multiple files into one. MIME format is used by web browsers when saving a web page as a single file or by reporting tools for the same purpose.
