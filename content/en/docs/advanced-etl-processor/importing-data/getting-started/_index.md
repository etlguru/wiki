## Background

Import script was brought into Advanced ETL Processor to make it compatible with Visual Importer ETL. Unlike Transformation it only offers data Import functionality. Loading data using Import Script is slightly faster than doing the same using Transformation.

## Shall use Import Script or Transformation?

For all new projects, we recommend using Transformation because it offers much more functionality.
