## About

Online storage systems, or "cloud" services as they're also known, allow you to store digital media online by uploading via your computer or mobile device. Though transferred and accessible via the web, the data is actually physically held in datacentres located around the world, often owned by whoever provides the particular service you use (Google, Microsoft or Dropbox).

Our software supports the following cloud storage providers: DropBox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Box, Amazon Cloud Drive, Hubic, HiDrive and Yandex Disk.
