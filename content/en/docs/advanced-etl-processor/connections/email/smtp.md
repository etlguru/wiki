## About SMTP

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP3 or IMAP4. In addition, SMTP is generally used to send messages from a mail client to a mail server.
