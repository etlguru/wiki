## Excel cell formatting

{{< image class="mx-auto d-block"  src="/images/etl/advanced-etl-processor/transforming-data/writer/excel-formatting.png" title="Excel cell formatting" >}}

### Formulas

{{< image class="mx-auto d-block"  src="/images/etl/advanced-etl-processor/transforming-data/writer/excel-data-formulas.png" title="Formulas" >}}

### Notes

1 To create date fields use the standard Date Format function

{{< image src="/images/etl/advanced-etl-processor/transformation-functions/date_format_transformation_function.png" title="Date Format" >}}

2 Untick "Recalculate Excel Files" to improve performance if the Excel file has no formulas

### Combining multiple data sources into a single excel file

Point all writers to the same file. In the example below, "Writer C1" adds data to the C1 excel sheet andÂ "Writer C2" adds data to the C2 excel sheet. This not only makes the life of our ETL software users easier but also improves performance.

{{< image class="mx-auto d-block"  src="/images/etl/advanced-etl-processor/transforming-data/excel-transformations.png" title="Excel Transformation" >}}

#### Important notes

- Point all writers to the same file
- Make sure that Create a new file/Add Data Into Existing File is the same for all writers
- If one of the writers has selected "Recalculate Excel File" the file will be recalculated
