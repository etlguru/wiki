## About Tableau

Tableau is a business intelligence software that allows anyone to connect to data in a few clicks, then visualize and create interactive, shareable dashboards with a few more. It's easy enough that any Excel user can learn it, but powerful enough to satisfy even the most complex analytical problems. Securely sharing your findings with others only takes seconds.

The result is BI software that you can trust to actually deliver answers to the people that need them.

## What is a .tde file?

The TDE data file format is used by Tableau Desktop, a whiteboard visualization and analysis application. It may contain data extracted from external sources such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access. TDE files are used for storing external data in a format recognized by the Tableau software. These pieces of data can be text, numerical and statistical data among others. This software must be installed into the system in order to allow the user to create, open and modify the content of these TDE files. Since Tableau Desktop is implemented with compatibility support for widely used versions of Microsoft Windows, users of computers that run on these operating systems can install Tableau Desktop in order to start creating, opening, viewing and editing the content of these TDE files.
