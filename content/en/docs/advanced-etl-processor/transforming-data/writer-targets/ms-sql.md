## Check constraints

Ensure that any constraints on the destination table are checked during the bulk copy operation. By default, constraints are ignored.

## Keep identity

Specify that there are values in the data file for an identity column.

## Keep NULLS

Specify that any columns containing a null value should be retained as null values, even if a default value was specified for that column in the destination table.

## Batch size

Specify the number of rows in a batch. The default is the entire data file.
The following values for the Batch size property have these effects:

If **Batch size** is set to zero, the data is loaded in a single batch. The first row that fails will cause the entire load to be cancelled, and the step fails.

If **Batch size** is set to one, the data has loaded a row at a time. Each row that fails is counted as one-row failure. Previously loaded rows are committed.

If **Batch size** is set to a value greater than one, the data is loaded one batch at a time. Any row that fails in a batch fails that entire batch; loading stops and the step fails. Rows in previously loaded batches are either committed or if the step has joined the package transaction, provisionally retained in the transaction, subject to later commitment or rollback.
