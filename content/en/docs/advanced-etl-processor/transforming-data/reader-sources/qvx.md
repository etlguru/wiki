## About QVX

QVX (QlikView data eXchange) is a new file/stream format for high-performance data input into QlikView. A QVX formatted file contains metadata describing a table of data and the actual data. In contrast to the QVD format, which is proprietary and optimized for minimum transformations inside QlikView, the QVX format is public and requires a few transformations when exporting data from traditional database formats.
