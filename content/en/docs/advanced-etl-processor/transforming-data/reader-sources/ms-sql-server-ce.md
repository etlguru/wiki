## About Microsoft SQL Server Compact

Microsoft SQL Server Compact (EOL, See SQL Express) (SQL CE) is a compact relational database produced by Microsoft for applications that run on mobile devices and desktops. Prior to the introduction of the desktop platform, it was known as SQL Server for Windows CE and SQL Server Mobile Edition.

It includes both 32-bit and 64-bit native support. SQL CE targets occasionally connected applications and applications with an embedded database. It is free to download and redistribute.An ODBC driver for SQL CE does not exist, nor is one planned. Native applications may use SQL CE via OLE DB.

The latest, and last, release is the SQL Server Compact 4.0. In February 2013 SQL Server Compact Edition had been deprecated; no new versions or updates are planned, although Microsoft continued to support the product until July 2021.
