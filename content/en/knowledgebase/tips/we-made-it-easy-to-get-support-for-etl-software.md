The software is designed in such a way that it is easy to contact support.

For [Advanced ETL Processor](https://www.etl-tools.com/advanced-etl-processor/overview.html) click “Help” and then click “Email repository and Log Files to support” then the default email client will open and the user can enter additional information and attach more files. Using the same menu the user can send an email to the support team or visit the support forum.
