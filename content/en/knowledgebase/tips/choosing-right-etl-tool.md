We have two ETL products [Visual Importer ETL](https://www.etl-tools.com/visual-importer-etl-enterprise/overview.html) and [Advanced ETL Processor](https://www.etl-tools.com/advanced-etl-processor/overview.html).

Which one to choose depends on the complexity of the data and now you want to work with it

[This article provides some examples of complex data]({{<ref "what-is-complex-data" >}})

If you just want to load data from a table, delimited file or simple XML file choose Visual Importer ETL.

If you work with complex data and require data validation, transformation or sorting and on top of it you also want to be able to generate the data select Advanced ETL Processor.

## Edtions

Both Advanced ETL Processor and Visual Importer ETL have 3 editions:

### Standard Edition

Designed for the desktop user who just wants to run data load or transformation manually.

### Professional Edition

Designed for a user who wants to execute business automation processes manually (Developers).

### Enterprise Edition
