## Purpose

Library of objects stores transformation/package objects in the repository for reuse in other transformations or workflow packages

For example, if there is a series of transformations (lookup, add, if null, if empty, etc) that are reused we could design once and reuse them in other transformations. Works with both [Visual Importer ETL](https://www.etl-tools.com/advanced-etl-processor/online-tutorial.html) and [Advanced ETL Processor](https://www.etl-tools.com/advanced-etl-processor/overview.html)
